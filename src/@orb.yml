  With the CodeComet orb, you can instrument and monitor your tests' performance.
  Simply put in your existing test command, and CodeComet will ingest your test
  data and upload your performance metrics to our web app. Track the runtime, flakiness,
  memory, logs, and more for all of your tests!
# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.
